This is the first repository focus on the Front End aspects of the Jamies website (CoffeeHut) for Capstone Project
So this repo focuses on having a set list of products and providing product descriptions which will be visible to the consumers on the CoffeeHut web page. 
The list of file within this repo are Product_catalog.md, discount_plans.md, testimonials.md, and Freatured_Products.md
These files are crucial for knowing what products needs to displayed during the design of the web page and what description need to accompany the product.
As part of the design this website, consumers will be able to have access to discount that are added to the discount_plans.md
